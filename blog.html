                </h2>
                <p class="text-left font-style: italic text-amber-900 mt-12">Document object model is referred to as
                    DOM. All HTML webpages are referred to as
                    documents in the web world. To make it simpler to access and manage the elements, each of these web
                    pages is represented by the Document Object Model in a tree-like structure.<br>

                    It allows a platform to be language neutral and provide an interface that allows the dynamic usage
                    of the scripts and programs to access the content.It also provides a way to update the content,
                    structure and style of the document and a way to represent it in any language.It is used with the
                    language and used to create the objects that can be used as a model to allow the interface to be
                    developed with ease.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-left font-style: italic text-amber-900 mt-12">The HTML DOM uses event bubbling as a method of event propagation. It has to do with the sequence in which events pass between nested elements.When an event occurs in bubbling, the handler of the innermost element executes first, followed by the parents and further ancestor elements. In other words, as the DOM tree grows, events bubble up or propagate.<br>

                    A similar principle to event bubbling is event capturing, where events propagate inwards instead of outwards. Event bubbling and event capturing lay the foundation of event delegation.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-left font-style: italic text-amber-900 mt-12">A callback function is one of the superpowers of JavaScript. It is the way JavaScript passes a function into another function as an argument. The callback function is called in the outer function to execute an action.<br>

                    Arguments in JavaScript are values that are passed to the parameters of a function. They are accessible only in the function they are passed into when that function is called. Think of parameters as variables that are used to hold values in a function.
